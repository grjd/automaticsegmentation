**Abstract**

In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of automated segmentation of subcortical structures in the elderly brain. Manual segmentation is an extremely time-consuming task and automated methods are thus, gaining importance as clinical tool for diagnosis. In the last few years, AI-based segmentation has delivered in some cases superior results than manual segmentation, in both time and accuracy. 
To test the performance of automated segmentation methods, the two most commonly used software libraries for brain segmentation -FreeSurfer and FSL- are put to work in a large dataset of 4000 MRI data collected for this study.
We find a lack of linear correlation between the segmentation volume estimates obtained from FreeSurfer and FSL. On the other hand, FreeSurfer volume estimates tend to be larger than FSL estimates of the areas putamen, thalamus, amygdala, caudate, pallidum, hippocampus and accumbens.
In the era of big data, automated segmentation is called to play a preponderant role in medical imaging. The characterization of the performance of brain segmentation algorithms in large datasets as the one presented here, is a matter of scientific and clinical interest now and for the immediate future. 

**Dataset description**

The dataset contains two csv files: 
- *df_fsl_lon.csv* is the Pandas dataframe containing the results of the automated segmentation performed with FSL 
- *df_free_lon.csv* contains the  Pandas dataframe containing the results of the automated segmentation performed with FreeSurfer. 
The fields include in the dataset are as follows:
- _Age_ the age of the participant in the moemnt of performing the MRI scan (%.2f)
- _Sex_ encoded as 0 Male and 1 Female
- Subcortical Volume estimates use the nomenclature: _[fsl|free]_[R|L]|[strcture]_ where structure can be Thalamus, Accumbens, Pallidum, Hippocampus, Amygdala, Caudate and Putamen. The volume is expressed in mm^3.

**MRI Data collection**
A total of 4028 MRIs were collected in 5 years, 990 in the first visit, 768 in the second, 723 in the third, 634 in the fourth, 542 in the fifth, and 371 in the sixth year. The imaging data were acquired on a 3T General Electric scanner (GE Milwaukee) utilizing the following T1-weighted inversion recovery, flip angle 12Â°, 3-D pulse sequence: echo time _Min. full_, time inversion 600 ms, Receiver Bandwidth = 19.23 kHz, field of view = 24.0 cm, slice thickness = 1 mm, _Freq. x Phase = 288 x 288_.
The preprocessing of MRI 3 Tesla images in this study consisted of generating an isotropic brain image with non-brain tissue removed. We used the initial, preprocessing step in the two computational segmentation tool used in this study: FSL pipeline _(fsl-anat)_ and the FreeSurfer pipeline _(recon-all)_. 
We run both pipelines in an identical computational setting: Operating System Mac OS X, product version 10.14.5 and build version 18F132. The version of FreeSurfer is FreeSurfer-darwin-OSX-ElCapitan-dev-20190328-6241d26. The version of the BET tool for FSL is v2.1 - FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford and the FIRST tool version is 6.0.
